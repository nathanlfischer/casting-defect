# casting-defect

## Project

Captstone project #2 for HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science : Capstone, the final course in the Data Science Professional Certificate series. This project uses images of castings that have previously been classified as acceptable or unacceptable - pass or fail - to build machine learning models that are able to accurately classify new images of castings.

## File Description

code.R is the R script containing the code used for the project. It imports images, peforms the data analysis, creates machine learning models, and calculates accuracy and sensitivity. Written using R version 4.0.2.

report.Rmd is the report written in R Markdown format. Improvements in formatting were made over my capstone project #1 [movielens](https://github.com/nlfischer195/movielens), but it isn't as "crisp" as I would like it to be.

report.pdf is the R Markdown report exported as a pdf.

## Image Source

The casting images were sourced from the Kaggle dataset [casting product image data for quality inspection](https://www.kaggle.com/ravirajsinh45/real-life-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product).
